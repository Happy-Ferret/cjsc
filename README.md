CommonJS Compiler
==============

CJSC is a nodejs utility, which compiles CommonJS modules into a single JavaScript file that works natively in the browser.

The utility get especially handy when you want your JavaScript be modular yet keeping the application performance
by minimizing the number of HTTP requests

## Features

* Makes CommonJS modules available in the browser
* Does not require any library to resolve dependencies, just adds a tiny `require` function and definition wrappers to your original code
* Works fine with [UMD modules](https://github.com/umdjs/umd)

## Features inherited from CommonJS
* Allows splitting large projects into multiple files (modules) making web-application scalable and maintainable
* Enclosure every file in its own unique module context

## How to install

CommonJS Compiler relies on node.js. If you don't have node.js installed, just follow the instructions:
https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager

Make sure all the required dependencies installed
```bash
npm i
```
Make sure the binary is executable
```bash
chmod +x cjsc
```
You can also create a symlink to make it globally available
```bash
ln -s cjsc /usr/local/bin/cjsc
```

## How it works

Let's define a few CommonJS modules (http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1.1):

`./main.js`
```javascript
console.log( "main.js running..." );
console.log( "Imported name in main.js is `%s`", require( "./lib/dep1" ).name );
console.log( "Getting imported object from the cache:" );
console.log( " imported name in main.js is still `%s`", require( "./lib/dep1" ).name );
```

`./lib/dep1.js`
```javascript
console.log( "dep1.js running..." );
console.log( "Imported name in dep1.js is `%s`", require( "./dep2" ).name );
exports.name = "dep1";
```

`./lib/dep2.js`
```javascript
console.log( "dep2.js running..." );
exports.name = "dep2";
```

Now we can compile the modules:
```bash
cjsc main.js script.js
```

As we fire up script.js we get the following output:
```
main.js running...
dep1.js running...
dep2.js running...
Imported name in dep1.js is `dep2`
Imported name in main.js is `dep1`
Getting imported object from the cache:
 imported name in main.js is still `dep1`
```

## File Modules

If the exact filename is not found, then CJSC will try the
required filename with the added extension of .js.

## The `module` object
Every module has available `module` variable that references to an object representing the module.
Like in [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/api/modules.html) th object has following structure:

* module.id {string} - The identifier for the module.
* module.filename {string} - The fully resolved filename to the module.
* module.loaded {boolean} - Whether or not the module is done loading.
* module.parent {Object} - The module that required this one.
* module.children {Object[]} - The module objects required by this one

## Caching

Caching goes the same as in nodejs. Modules are cached after the first time they are loaded.
So every call to `require('foo')` returns exactly the same object, if it refers to the same file.

Multiple calls to `require('foo')` don't execute the module code multiple times.
